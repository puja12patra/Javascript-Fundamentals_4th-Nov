Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.
Ans.
In JavaScript, operators are categorized based on the number of operands they operate on. Here's a differentiation between unary, binary, and ternary operators, along with examples:

1. Unary Operators:
   - Operate on a single operand.
   - Examples:
     - Unary Plus `+`: Converts an operand to a number.
       javascript code:
       let num = "5";
       let result = +num; // converts "5" to 5
       console.log(result); // 5
      

     - Unary Minus `-`: Negates its operand.
       javascript code:
       let num = 10;
       let result = -num; // negates 10
       console.log(result); // -10
       

     - Logical NOT `!`: Returns the negation of its operand.
       javascript code:
       let isTrue = true;
       let result = !isTrue; // negates true
       console.log(result); // false
      

2. Binary Operators:
   - Operate on two operands.
   - Examples:
     - Addition `+`: Adds two operands.
       javascript code:
       let a = 5;
       let b = 10;
       let sum = a + b; // adds 5 and 10
       console.log(sum); // 15
      

     - Subtraction `-`: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
       javascript code:
       let a = 10;
       let b = 3;
       let difference = a - b; // subtracts 3 from 10
       console.log(difference); // 7
      

     - Assignment `=`: Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand.
      javascript code:
       let x = 5;
       let y = 10;
       x = y; // assigns the value of y to x
       console.log(x); // 10
      

3. Ternary Operator:
   - A single operator that takes three operands.
   - It's often used as a shorthand for an `if...else` statement.
   - Syntax: `condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse`
   - Example:
    javascript code:
     let age = 20;
     let result = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
     console.log(result); // "Adult" (if age is 20)
    

In summary, the key difference lies in the number of operands each type of operator works with. Unary operators have one operand, binary operators have two, and the ternary operator has three.
